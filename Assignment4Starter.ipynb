    "## Theory\n",
    "A football needs to follow a certain trajectory for a player to make a successful field goal. To score points, the player must send the ball between the goalposts. If the ball does not go far enough (the kick is \"short\"), or if the ball goes to the left or right of the goalposts instead of between them (the kick is \"wide\"), then the field goal does not count. There are many factors that can affect whether or not a field goal is good, including how the ball is held in place for the kicker, weather conditions like wind and rain, and how far the ball is from the goalposts. In this simulation, we ignore factors like air resitance and the Magnus effect and focus only on distance.\n",
